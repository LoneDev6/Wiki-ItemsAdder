# Manual editing blockstates

{% hint style="warning" %}
This breaks the purpose of ItemsAdder which is to avoid editing certain files manually.\
Do it at your own risk.
{% endhint %}

You can manually edit blockstates json files, in order to do that you can create a custom content folder and put your edited blockstates inside.

**ItemsAdder** will automatically merge any blockstate `.json` file found in the various contents folders with the **ItemsAdder** custom blocks (if you created any).
