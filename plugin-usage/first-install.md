## Resourcepack first installation

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Important Step

Content <mark style="color:red;">**WILL NOT SHOW CORRECTLY**</mark> if you won't complete this step!
{% endhint %}

Before using the plugin you have to decide the resourcepack hosting method.\
Read [this tutorial](resourcepack-hosting/) to decide the hosting method for the resourcepack.\
The best method is `self-host`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## (optional) Add official ItemsAdder custom content



![](../.gitbook/assets/items_showcase_gif.apng)

**ItemsAdder** comes with a lot of custom content already created for you.\
It's not automatically included in the downloaded plugin because some people might not want every item/feature automatically added into their server.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## (optional) Add other ItemsAdder custom content

#### Download the Other Packs here:

{% embed url="https://github.com/ItemsAdder/OtherPacks/releases/latest" %}

<div align="left"><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (94).png" alt=""></div>

* Extract the content into the `ItemAsdder` folder and overwrite the files if asked.
* Run the `/iazip` command.
* Follow your [hosting method](resourcepack-hosting/) if you're not using **self-host**.
