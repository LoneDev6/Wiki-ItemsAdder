# Custom PlayerStats

## What are PlayerStats?

They custom attributes added by ItemsAdder, you can add and read them using a special command: `/iaplayerstat`

You can then use PlaceholderAPI to show them anywhere or bind them to a HUD (like I did for thirst and mana, check my configs for examples).

Example: `/iaplayerstat read LoneDev thirst float`
