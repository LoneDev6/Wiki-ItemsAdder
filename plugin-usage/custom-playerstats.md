# Custom player stats

## What are player stats?

They custom attributes added by ItemsAdder, you can add and read them using a special command: `/iaplayerstat`

You can then use **PlaceholderAPI** to show them anywhere or bind them to a HUD.\
I did that to create thirst and mana. Check my [default configs](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AItemsAdder%2FDefaultPack+player\_stat\_name\&type=code) for examples.

### Example:&#x20;

`/iaplayerstat write LoneDev thirst 6`\
`/iaplayerstat read LoneDev thirst float`

## Saving player stats

### Custom NBT file

Saving them into a custom NBT file handled by ItemsAdder which can be later deleted easily.\
This file is saved into `plugins\ItemsAdder\storage\players\stats\` folder.

```yaml
player_stats:
  save_type: CUSTOM_NBT
```

### player.dat file

Saving them into the vanilla `player.dat` file.\
This is useful if you want to sync your server and you already sync the player dat files.

```yaml
player_stats:
  save_type: PLAYER_DAT
```
