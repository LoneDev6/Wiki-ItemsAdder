### With ItemsAdder it's easy to share your creations without having to copy and paste files!

Use the command `/iaexport <NAMESPACE>` to export all your namespace configurations and textures/models into a zip file you can share with your friends or on [https://addons.devs.beer/itemsadder/](https://addons.devs.beer/itemsadder/)

The zip file will be available in this folder`plugins\ItemsAdder\data\compressed_out`
