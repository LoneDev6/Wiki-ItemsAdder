# ðŸ—ƒ Merge resourcepacks

## Why merging?

**Minecraft** supports **only 1 server resourcepack**, so if you have more than one resourcepack you need to merge them.

## How to merge?

### Step 1

Copy the `assets` folder of your resourcepack.

### Step 2

Paste the `assets` folder of your resourcepack inside the **ItemsAdder** folder: `plugins\ItemsAdder\data\resource_pack\`

### Step 3

Open `config.yml` of **ItemsAdder** and set this option:

```yaml
overwrite-vanilla-models: false
```

### Step 4

Use the `/iazip` command to compress the ItemsAdder resourcepack.\
(Make sure to follow the correct [hosting tutorial](../resourcepack-hosting/) based on the hosting method you decided)

### Done.
