# ðŸ—ƒ Merge resourcepacks

{% hint style="danger" %}
### ItemsAdder 3.3+ only!

## Why merging?

**Minecraft** supports **only 1 server resourcepack**.\
**I**f you have more than one resourcepack you need to merge them.

## How to merge?

### Step 1

Copy the `assets` folder of your resourcepack.

### Step 2

Paste the `assets` folder of your resourcepack inside a new `contents` sub-folder.\
For example `merged_pack_1`: `ItemsAdder/contents/merged_pack_1/resourcepack/`

### Step 3

Use the `/iazip` command to compress the ItemsAdder resourcepack.\
(Make sure to follow the correct [hosting tutorial](../resourcepack-hosting/) based on the hosting method you decided).

### Step 4 (advanced users)

If you are merging more than 1 pack you might need to decide a merge priority.\
Open config.yml and write the load priority order of your `contents` sub-folders folders.

{% code title="config.yml" %}
```yaml
    contents-folders-priorities:
      - vanilla
      - _iainternal
      - merged_pack_1
      - merged_pack_2
      - merged_pack_3
      # ... other packs here of which you want to change load order.
```
{% endcode %}

### Done.
