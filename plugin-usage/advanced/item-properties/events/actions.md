* `target_potion_effect`
* `target_remove_potion_effect`
* `play_totem_animation`

### Delay

{% hint style="info" %}
Every action has a special attribute **delay**.\
It's the **delay** in ticks before starting the action.\
For example:

```yaml
items:
  chain_events:
    display_name: "%#FE5A00%chain_events"
    permission: test.chain_events
    resource:
      material: COAL
      generate: true
      textures:
      - "minecraft:item/diamond.png"
    events:
      interact:
        right:
          execute_commands:
            cmd1:
              command: 'tellraw {player} {"text":"Action 1","color":"gold"}'
              as_console: true
              delay: 0
            cmd2:
              command: 'tellraw {player} {"text":"Action 2","color":"gold"}'
              as_console: true
              delay: 20
            cmd3:
              command: 'tellraw {player} {"text":"Action 3","color":"gold"}'
              as_console: true
              delay: 40
          play_sound_1:
            name: minecraft:block.note_block.banjo
            delay: 0
          play_sound_2:
            name: minecraft:block.note_block.banjo
            pitch: 1.2
            delay: 20
          play_sound_3:
            name: minecraft:block.note_block.banjo
            pitch: 1.5
            delay: 40
```
{% endhint %}

### Multiple actions of the same type

{% hint style="info" %}
You can set the same action multiple times. You just have to add `_anything` at the end.\
For example if you want to play two sounds you have to write this:

```yaml
play_sound_first:
  name: itemsadder:ambient.creepy
  volume: 1
  pitch: 1
play_sound_second:
  name: minecraft:ambient.cave
  volume: 1
  pitch: 1
play_sound_3:
  name: minecraft:ambient.cave
  volume: 1
  pitch: 1
```
{% endhint %}

### Actions permission

{% hint style="info" %}
Every action has a special attribute **permission**.\
It's the **permission** the player must have before starting the **action**.\
For example the player must have `myitems.usage.secret_items_dispenser` permission to play the sound.\
In this example you will notice an "issue". The sound is played even if the user has no permission for the give event. That's because... well, permission check is only on the give\_item.

```yaml
  test_block:
    display_name: display-name-test_block
    permission: test_block
    resource:
      material: PAPER
      generate: true
      textures:
      - block/test_block.png
    specific_properties:
      block:
        placed_model:
          type: REAL_NOTE
          break_particles_material: SMITHING_TABLE
    events:
      placed_block:
        interact:
          give_item:
            permission: "myitems.usage.secret_items_dispenser"
            item: DIAMOND
          play_sound:
            name: itemsadder:ambient.creepy
            volume: 1
            pitch: 1
```

###

### Setting the same permission to every action

If you want to set the same permission to every action without copy and paste you can!\
Use this special attribute `all_actions_permission`.\
For example:

```yaml
  test_block:
    display_name: display-name-test_block
    permission: test_block
    resource:
      material: PAPER
      generate: true
      textures:
      - block/test_block.png
    specific_properties:
      block:
        placed_model:
          type: REAL_NOTE
          break_particles_material: SMITHING_TABLE
    all_actions_permission: "myitems.usage.secret_items_dispenser"
    events:
      placed_block:
        interact:
          give_item:
            item: DIAMOND
      play_sound:
        name: itemsadder:ambient.creepy
        volume: 1
        pitch: 1
```
{% endhint %}
