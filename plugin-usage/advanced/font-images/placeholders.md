# Placeholders

You can use these special placeholders in **chat**, **signs**, **books** and in **GUIs** names.

### Offset

This is a special placeholder that allows you to move a font image back and forward specifying pixels number.

```
:offset_-1:
:offset_-2:
:offset_-30:
:offset_25:
```

As you can see you have to write `:offset_`**`AMOUNT`**`:` (without spaces).

### Actual image

To actually show make your font image show up you just have to write down its name surrounded by `:` character

```
:my_gui:
:blank_menu:
:my_emoji:
```
