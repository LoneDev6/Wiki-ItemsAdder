# 3D model

## Creating the animated model (idle animation)

To create the models I use [BlockBench](https://blockbench.net), it's very easy to use and fast.\
BlockBench [tutorials ](https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=blockbench+tutorial)are available on YouTube.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You have to make sure to create your model as Java Block/Item model! Don't use Bedrock Model or Entity model!

### Creating a very simple idle animation

For example I created this model, it's made of some cubes as you can see.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (52).png>)

Now we want to animate it!\
For example I want to make it float up and down.

**1.Save** the **current model** in a temporary folder (anywhere on your PC)

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (53).png>)

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (56).png>)

Ok I saved it as **1.json** inside the **idle** folder. This is the first frame of the **animation**.

**2.**Return to **BlockBench** and select all pressing **CTRL+A**

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (57).png>)

**Hold left mouse button** while cliking on the **GREEN** arrow, **hold CTRL** and **move** the mouse **up** a little bit

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (58).png>)

**3.Save** the file again but change the name to **2.json**

**4.**Do the same thing 3 times (move the mob a little bit up) and save the file again increasing the number in its file name.

**5.**Now we have finished creating the needed frames for our animation. Open [this website](https://lonedev6.github.io/animated-models/)

**6.**Now **click** on the **icon** to load our json frames

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (68).png>)

**7.**Click on "**Choose files...**" and select your json files and the png texture

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (77).png>)

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (69).png>)

**8.**Click on **LOAD**

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (70).png>)

**9.Click** the **second icon** and **drag** and **drop** the **4 files** to the bottom line

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (71).png>)

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (72).png>)

**10.**You should have them like that

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (73).png>)

**11.**Drag and drop them again but in reverse (3-2**, I skipped 1 and 4 because they would be useless for the animation**)

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (75).png>)

**12.**Press the **play** button (on the **bottom left**) to **preview** the animation

**13.** Press "**Export**" button (**top right** of the **screen**) and configure it like in the screenshot, then press "**Export**" again.

**14.**Now you will have a **zip** file with the animation, **download** it and **open** it.

**15.Extract** the zip inside your **ItemsAdder** folder `data\resource_pack\`

**16.**Set your mob configuration like this, to use the idle animation and not the stuck one: `"mob/soul/idle"`

```yaml
items:
  soul:
    display_name: display-name-soul
    permission: creaturesplus
    click_in_ia_gui: false
    resource:
      generate: false
      model_path: "mob/soul/idle"
```

**17.**Use the command `/iazip` (if you're using external-host please follow the [tutorial ](../../../../resourcepack-hosting/)carefully)

**18.**spawn the mob using `/iasummon soul`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not open the animated model (exported from the website) with BlockBench or any other editing program or it will probably break and stop working.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can delete the 1-2-3-4.json files, you don't need them anymore (but you can backup them for future usage), you only need the idle.json file and the png+mcmeta files which are the animated files.
