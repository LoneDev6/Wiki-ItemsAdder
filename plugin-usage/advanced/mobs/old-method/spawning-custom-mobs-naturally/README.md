### Using MythicMobs

This is a bit harder and not for beginners. You need to install [MythicMobs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9A%94-mythicmobs-free-version-%E2%96%BAthe-1-custom-mob-creator%E2%97%84.5702/).\
This will allow you to use all the extended features of MythicMobs and apply a custom model to your custom mob.
