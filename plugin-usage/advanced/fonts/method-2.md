# PNG font (easier)

{% hint style="info" %}
## This method allows you to add fonts using .png files
{% endhint %}

## Example font

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (13).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
This font is made by Faithful team, please check their work: [https://faithful.team/](https://faithful.team)
{% endhint %}

To this you have to:

* download the Faithful font [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/06et55587zvcmr7/FaithfulFont.zip?dl=0)
* extract contents into `plugins\ItemsAdder\data\resource_pack\`
* and obviously if you're using [dropbox host](../../resourcepack-hosting/resourcepack-on-dropbox.md) you have to reupload the pack.zip after server restart
