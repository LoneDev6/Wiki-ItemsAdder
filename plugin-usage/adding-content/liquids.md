# Liquids

{% hint style="warning" %}
Refer to [the FAQ](../../faq/liquids-issues.md) to read about limitations of this feature.
{% endhint %}

To create a custom liquids you have to add it in a new `.yml` file.\
In this case I created a new liquid called `red_water` in my new `my_liquids` namespace.

{% code title="contents/my_liquids/liquids.yml" %}
```yaml
info:
  namespace: my_liquids
liquids:
  red_water:
    color: RED
```
{% endcode %}

To place the liquids you have to create a custom bucket.\
In this example I created the `red_water_bucket`.

```yaml
  red_water_bucket:
    display_name: display-name-red_water_bucket
    permission: red_water_bucket
    resource:
      material: POTION
      generate: true
      texture: "item/red_water_bucket"
    behaviours:
      liquid_bucket:
        name: "my_liquids:red_water"
```

Run `/iazip` to regenerate the resourcepack.

Use the bucket to place the custom water.

### Features

Liquids for now do not have any feature other than being decorative.\
In the future I might implement some custom features.
