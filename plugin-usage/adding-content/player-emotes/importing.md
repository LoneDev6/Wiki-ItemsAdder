# Importing

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is a temporary tutorial. There will be a import export button in the future to easily import export emotes.
{% endhint %}

You can import emotes from packs shared online, without replacing your own emotes.

### Step 1

Open the other file you want to import emotes from, in this example `custom_emotes.iaentitymodel` .

Open also the `player.iaentitymodel` file inside the plugin folder `ItemsAdder\data\resource_pack\assets\minecraft\animations`

### Step 2

Select one emote and press CTRL+C, then press CTRL+V inside the `player.iaentitymodel` file.\
Do that for every emote you want to import.

### Done
