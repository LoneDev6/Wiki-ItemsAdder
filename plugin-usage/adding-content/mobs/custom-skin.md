# Custom Animated Player

## Getting custom skins

You can get a [list](https://mineskin.org/gallery) of possible skins and even upload [your own](https://mineskin.org/)!

{% hint style="success" %}
You don't need to run `/iazip`! These skins are loaded at runtime without any resourcepack download.
{% endhint %}

## Spawning the entity

Use the command `/iaentity summonplayer <skin>`.

### Example

`/iaentity summonplayer https://minesk.in/5f1e7ff6409e428bb500cc9315bf7ffb`
