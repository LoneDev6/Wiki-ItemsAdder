# Bow

The bow animates as you pull it, this allows you to have a single texture for each of these states.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is very important to set the textures to your bow item that should have set them to avoid problem with missing texture:

{% endhint %}

To use the status textures, you need to add suffixes to your model filename or texture.

If you plan to use textures (png) you had to set `generate: true`.\
If you plan to use models (json) you have to set `generate: false`, as you already have the models.&#x20;

## Suffixes for items

* `BOW`
  * `_0` - First pulling state
  * `_1` - Second pulling state
  * `_2` - Third pulling state
* `FISHING_ROD`
  * `_cast` - Shows a fishing rod when it is cast
* `SHIELD`
  * `_blocking` - Shows a shield model when you are blocking with it
* `BUNDLE`
  * `_filled` - Displays a bundle when it is filled

## Adding item states using suffixes (bow)

Firstly you need to create three pulling states for our bow

![](../../.gitbook/assets/bow\_pulling\_states.gif)

Save them, drop to the directory where is your original bow texture and add suffixes to your textures like this:

I put them into `contents/myitems/textures/item/` folder of my resourcepack.

<div align="left">

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/bow_suffixes_textures.png" alt="">

</div>

{% hint style="info" %}
Suffixes also work on model names (json).\
I put them into `contents/myitems/models/item/` folder of my resourcepack.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/bow_suffixes_models.png" alt="" data-size="original">
{% endhint %}

```yaml
items:
  ruby_bow:
    enabled: true
    display_name: Example Ruby Bow
    permission: myitems.bows.ruby_bow
    resource:
      material: BOW
      generate: true
      textures:
        - item/bows/ruby_bow
```

## Done

You have working bow with item states
