# Directional Blocks

{% hint style="info" %}
## Requires ItemsAdder 4.0.10 or greater
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Warning

Creating directional blocks will occupy 4 or 6 slots per block.\
This happens because each direction is a different block.

There is no way to bypass that. It's a limitation of the game and any other content creation plugin would have this limitation.\
You should not abuse directional blocks because they quickly will saturate your custom blocks usages.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
`FURNACE` and `DROPPER` won't act like the vanilla machinery. They are just names to easily understand the type of block rotation.
{% endhint %}

### Directional mode

### Mode `FURNACE`

Act like vanilla furnace.

```yml
  directional_block_furnace:
    name: directional_block_furnace
    resource:
      material: PAPER
      generate: true
      textures:
      - block/furnace/directional_block_test_down.png
      - block/furnace/directional_block_test_east.png
      - block/furnace/directional_block_test_north.png
      - block/furnace/directional_block_test_south.png
      - block/furnace/directional_block_test_up.png
      - block/furnace/directional_block_test_west.png
    specific_properties:
      block:
        placed_model:
          type: REAL_NOTE
          directional_mode: FURNACE
```

### Mode `LOG`

Act like vanilla logs.

```yml
  directional_block_log:

      material: PAPER
      generate: true
      textures:
      - block/log/directional_block_test_down.png

      - block/log/directional_block_test_south.png
      - block/log/directional_block_test_up.png
      - block/log/directional_block_test_west.png
    specific_properties:
      block:
        placed_model:
          type: REAL_NOTE
          directional_mode: LOG
```

### Mode `DROPPER`

Acts like the vanilla dropper.

In this particular case I decided to overwrite the automatically generated directional blocks `up` and `down` to customize the appearance of the block in this particular case, setting a different texture for the `north` face (front).\
In the screenshot you can see the face texture is different.

```yml
  directional_block_dropper:
    name: directional_block_dropper

      - block/dropper/directional_block_test_west.png
    specific_properties:
      block:
        placed_model:
