# Adding Content

ItemsAdder allows you to create a wide variety of custom content for your Minecraft server. This section provides detailed instructions for adding different types of custom elements to enhance your gameplay experience.

## Content Types Overview

ItemsAdder supports creating many types of custom content, including:

- **Items**: Custom tools, weapons, and general items with unique textures and properties
- **Blocks**: Decorative or functional blocks with custom textures and behaviors
- **Furniture**: Interactive 3D models that function as decorative elements
- **Armors**: Custom armor sets with unique textures and attributes
- **Food/Consumables**: Items that can be eaten with custom effects
- **Emotes**: Custom player animations
- **GUIs and HUDs**: Custom interfaces and displays
- **Fonts and Visual Elements**: Custom text styling and visual indicators

## General Workflow

Most custom content in ItemsAdder follows this general workflow:

1. **Create configuration files** for your content in YAML format
2. **Add resource files** (textures, models, sounds) to the appropriate folders
3. **Configure properties** specific to the content type
4. **Test and refine** your content in-game

## Namespaces

ItemsAdder organizes content into "namespaces" to keep things organized and prevent conflicts:

- Each custom content pack should use its own unique namespace
- Default ItemsAdder content uses the "ia" namespace
- It's recommended to use a short, descriptive name for your namespace (e.g., "myserver")

## Getting Started

If you're new to creating custom content with ItemsAdder, we recommend:

1. First reviewing the [Beginners](../beginners/) section
2. Starting with simple items before moving to more complex content
3. Using the examples in each subsection as templates for your own creations
