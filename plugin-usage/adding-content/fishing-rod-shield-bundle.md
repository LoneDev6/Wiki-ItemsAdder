# Fishing rod, shield, bundle

To use the status textures, you need to add suffixes to your model filename or texture.

If you plan to use textures (png) you had to set `generate: true`.\
If you plan to use models (json) you have to set `generate: false`, as you already have the models.&#x20;

* `FISHING_ROD`
  * `_cast` - Shows a fishing rod when it is cast.
  * No suffix - Shows the fishing rod in the normal state, when it's not cast.
* `SHIELD`
  * `_blocking` - Shows a shield model when you are blocking with it.
* `BUNDLE`
  * `_filled` - Displays a bundle when it is filled.

## Adding item states using suffixes

Refer to the bow tutorial, just add the missing image files.
