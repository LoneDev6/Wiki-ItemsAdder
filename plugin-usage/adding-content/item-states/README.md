# Item States
Item States has an item that can have multiple states e.g bow. The bow animates as you pull it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is very important to set Item States to your item that should have set them to avoid problem with missing texture:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/bow_without_item_states.gif>)
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="using-filenames.md" %}
[using-filenames.md](using-filenames.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
