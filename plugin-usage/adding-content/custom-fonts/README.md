## Example custom font

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/immagine%20%285%29.png)

To this you have to:

* download the japanese font [here](http://matteodev.it/spigot/itemsadder/res/v2/font.zip)
* extract contents into `plugins\ItemsAdder\data\resource_pack\assets\minecraft\font`
* open config.yml and set `custom-font enabled: true`
* and obviously if you're using [dropbox host](../../resourcepack-hosting/resourcepack-on-dropbox.md) you have to reupload the pack.zip after server restart
