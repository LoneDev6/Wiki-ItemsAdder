# ðŸ’Ž Worlds populators

### Example: two populators

```yaml
worlds_populators:
  custom_block:
    block: myitems:custom_block
    worlds:
    - world
    replaceable_blocks:
    - STONE
    - DIRT
    - ANDESITE
    - GRANITE
    - COBBLESTONE
    - GRAVEL
    biomes:
    - PLAINS
    chunk_chance: 70.0
    max_height: 45
    min_height: 25
    vein_blocks: 6
    chunk_veins: 1
  custom_block_2:
    block: myitems:custom_block_2
    worlds:
    - world
    replaceable_blocks:
    - DIRT
    chunk_chance: 100.0
    max_height: 64
    min_height: 40
    vein_blocks: 3
    chunk_veins: 1
```

This code allows you to tell ItemsAdder to generate the block "myitems:custom\_block" in the world named "world" and replace only block of types STONE, DIRT, ANDESITE, GRANITE, COBBLESTONE, GRAVEL and only in biome PLAINS.\
It will spawn 1 vein made of 3 blocks in each chunk.

### vein\_blocks, chunk\_veins, chunk\_chance

{% hint style="warning" %}
I suggest you to read values from the `blocks.yml` file I created in the **ItemsAdder** folder.\
Don't put too high values or the server could lag.\
Take my values as example.
{% endhint %}

**chunk\_veins**: number of veins to be spawned in the chunk\
**vein\_blocks**: number of blocks in each ore vein (or the **vein size**)\
**chunk\_chance**: chance of that generation to happen in the chunk. You should set it to 100 to normal ores and lower it down for more rare ores.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**Old ItemsAdder**</mark> versions before **3.1.6** used these properties instead:\
`chunk_veins` -> `iterations`

`vein_blocks` -> `amount`

`chunk_chance` -> `chance`
{% endhint %}

### Biomes

You can remove this option and the plugin will spawn ores in every biome.

```yaml
  custom_block:
    block: myitems:custom_block
    worlds:
    - world
    replaceable_blocks:
    - STONE
    - DIRT
    - ANDESITE
    - GRANITE
    - COBBLESTONE
    - GRAVEL
    chunk_chance: 70.0
    max_height: 45
    min_height: 25
    vein_blocks: 6
    chunk_veins: 1
```

### Replaceable blocks

You can remove this option and the plugin will spawn ores replacing every block instead of checking if it can be replaced.

```yaml
  custom_block:
    block: myitems:custom_block
    worlds:
    - world
    chunk_chance: 70.0
    max_height: 45
    min_height: 25
    vein_blocks: 6
    chunk_veins: 1
```
