# Beginners Guide to ItemsAdder

Welcome to the ItemsAdder Beginners Guide! This section is designed to help you get started with creating custom content for your Minecraft server, even if you have no prior experience with custom plugins or resource packs.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn the fundamentals of creating custom content with ItemsAdder, including:

- How to navigate and edit configuration files
- Understanding the contents folder structure
- Tips for efficient resourcepack management
- Step-by-step tutorials for creating basic custom items

## Before You Begin

Before diving into content creation, make sure you have:

1. Successfully [installed ItemsAdder](../first-install.md) on your server
2. Set up a [resourcepack hosting method](../resourcepack-hosting/)
3. Familiarized yourself with basic YAML syntax (used in configuration files)
4. Prepared a text editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Recommended Learning Path

If you're completely new to ItemsAdder, we recommend following this learning path:

1. Start with the [Video Tutorials](video-tutorials.md) to get a visual understanding
2. Learn about the [Files Editor](files-editor.md) to set up your editing environment
3. Understand the [Contents Folder](configs-and-resourcepack.md) structure
4. Review the [Good Resourcepack Tips](fast-resourcepack-tips.md) to avoid common pitfalls
5. Create your first custom item by following the [My First Sword](sword.md) tutorial
6. Progress to creating your first [Custom Block](my-first-block.md)
7. Try making a [Custom Bow](my-first-bow.md) to learn about weapons with special properties

## Key Concepts

As you work through the beginner tutorials, keep these important concepts in mind:

### Namespaces

ItemsAdder organizes content using "namespaces" to prevent conflicts between different content packs. Think of a namespace as a unique identifier for your content collection. For example, the official ItemsAdder content uses the namespace `ia`.

### Resource Files

Custom items require both configuration files (YAML) and resource files (textures, models, sounds). Understanding how these work together is essential for creating successful custom content.

### Configuration Structure

ItemsAdder uses a specific structure for configuration files that defines how items look and behave. Learning this structure will enable you to create increasingly complex items.
