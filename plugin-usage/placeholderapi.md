# PAPI placeholders

## FontImage (emoji etc)

This is the code: `%img_NAME%` instead of NAME write the font\_image name.\
For example: `%img_smile%`

## Offsets

You can shift text/font\_images back and forward.\
For example&#x20;

* you can shift it back of 16 pixels by writing `%img_offset_-16%` .
* you can shift it forward of 16 pixels by writing `%img_offset_16%` .

## ItemsAdder PlayerStats (HUDs values)

These are stats used by ItemsAdder, they're not vanilla stats.

This is the code: `%iaplayerstat_NAME%` instead of NAME write the playerstat name.\
For example: `%iaplayerstat_mana%` or also `%iaplayerstat_thirst%`

You can use this command to test it out:\
`/papi parse me %iaplayerstat_thirst%`\
`/papi parse me %iaplayerstat_mana%`
