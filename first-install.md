# ⚙ First install

{% hint style="info" %}
**You should follow** this first configuration **on** your **test server** on your PC to **avoid mistakes** and too many restarts.. players don't like when server is offline.\
You can upload files to your real server after you finished here.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
You **should** complete ALL installation steps. Not only the first.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1 - installing the plugin and APIs

* install [**ProtocolLib**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)
* install [**LoneLibs**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lonelibs.75974/)
* (optional) install **LightAPI** ([1.14, 1.15, 1.16](http://a.devs.beer/lightapi-old) | [1.17, 1.18](http://a.devs.beer/lightapi-new))
* (optional) install [**Lib's Disguises**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/libs-disguises-free.81/) if you plan to create custom mobs in the future.
* put **ItemsAdder.jar** file inside your plugins folder
* start the server
* let ItemsAdder finish loading **everything**

First step is done.\
Now you must complete **step 2** to configure the resourcepack (don't worry it's not very hard).

## Step 2 - resourcepack first installation

#### Decide the resourcepack hosting method:

{% content-ref url="plugin-usage/resourcepack-hosting/" %}
[resourcepack-hosting](plugin-usage/resourcepack-hosting/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Optional steps

### Removing default items

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't care about my default stuff and you only want to make your own items, blocks and other things it's easy!
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="faq/removing-default-stuff.md" %}
[removing-default-stuff.md](faq/removing-default-stuff.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Avoid glitched blocks (if you have Purpur installed)

{% content-ref url="faq/blocks-minerals-issues/custom-blocks-glitch-texture/avoid-glitched-blocks.md" %}
[avoid-glitched-blocks.md](faq/blocks-minerals-issues/custom-blocks-glitch-texture/avoid-glitched-blocks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
