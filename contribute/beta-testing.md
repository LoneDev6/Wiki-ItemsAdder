# 🧪 Beta testing

If you own **ItemsAdder** you can apply to become part of the **beta testing** team.\
Feel free to apply, but only if you own ItemsAdder (bought from Spigot, BuiltByBit or Polymart).\
I will approve each issued request if it satisfies the development needs.

Thanks everyone :smile: This will help me to make the plugin more stable and better.
