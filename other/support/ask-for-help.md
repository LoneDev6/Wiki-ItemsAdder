### Before You Start

You can ask for help after you `âœ… verified` your payment and got access to the channels

### Asking for help on discord

Due to the high volume of users you can't open support tickets\
use `#ia-comunity-help` discord channel to open support requests

After opening the "support request" you need to provide full info:

1. **Full Server Logs**\
   Paste the log [here ](https://mclo.gs/)& share the link.\
   If your problem doesn't require the server log the follow step 2.
2. **Full Configuration**\
   Provide full configuration of the iteamsadder & all the things that are not working\
   this will save a lot of time because we can analyze the files and help you better identify the problem.&#x20;
3. **Images & Video's**\
   Share more info, as the old saying goes "one picture a thousand worlds". \
   if you want to record a video of the steps that you are doing to produce the problem\
   it will save time and solve your problems faster.
4. **Good Description**\
   Provide us with a full description of your problem:\
   "emojis not working" is not a good explanation, and we as a support team won't be able to help you.\
   also, get to the point no one want's to read books.&#x20;
