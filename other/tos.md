### How to ask for support

{% embed url="https://forum.devs.beer/d/16-getting-support" %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Before Buying Remember:

* ‚õî If you have another plugin that uses a custom resource pack you have to know how to merge it with the ItemsAdder resource pack or disable the other plugin. A tutorial is available [here](../plugin-usage/merge-resourcepacks.md).
* ‚õî Before asking for support, please read the tutorials of this wiki.
* ‚õî You must have some knowledge on how to create/manage/merge vanilla Minecraft resource packs as this plugin uses a custom-made and modified resource pack to show custom textures/models.\
  Please if you have no knowledge about resource packs don't buy the plugin!
* ‚õî It's impossible to write a complete list of compatible/incompatible plugins without testing every single plugin on the planet. If the plugin doesn't work with your server setup don't ask for a refund but [report it](tos.md#how-to-ask-for-support-properly) and I'll try to find a solution.
* ‚õî [Not compatible with some plugins](https://itemsadder.devs.beer/compatibility-with-other-plugins/not-compatible)
{% endhint %}

### No Refunds¬π

Refunds are typically at the seller's discretion and might be issued on particular cases.\
Contact the seller using the forum or via email before opening an official dispute on the payment platform (PayPal, Stripe, etc.).

¬πExcept as required by applicable state law.

### Resource Pack

This plugin **requires** your **users** to **download** a **resource pack** (which is sent automatically on join) one time.\
This Plugin may not work with plugins that are using server texture packs, [read this to see if your plugin is compatible](../compatibility-with-other-plugins/).\
There is no Minecraft plugin which allows you to load custom assets without resource packs, it's not an ItemsAdder limitation, that's how the game works.

### Server Software

This plugin works with Spigot and Paper, I can't guarantee that the plugin will work on other Spigot forks.\
By using other server software solutions you agree that the plugin may not work correctly.

### **Plugin Ownership**

DO NOT DECOMPILE, RESELL, CRACK, OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PLUGIN.

You may **only use** the **plugin** on a **server** that **you are** an **owner** of.\
Bungeecord networks are also allowed.\
You Must ensure that your staff won't leak the plugin and keep your JAR safe.\
\
If you want to transfer your account or your license to another account you have to provide a valid explanation about why, by opening a ticket on the Discord server.

### Bugs & Issues & Support

If you have any problems **do not leave one-star review** to gain my attention, it does the opposite.\
I can fix bugs only if you report them in the right place.\
Please be sure to read tutorials before asking for help.\
Check the [FAQ](https://itemsadder.devs.beer/faq) for more info.\
