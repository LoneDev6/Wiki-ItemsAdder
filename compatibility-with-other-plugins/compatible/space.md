## How to add compatibility?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Update ItemsAdder to 2.4.20
{% endhint %}

It's very easy!

* Stop the server
* Open `plugins\Space\config.yml`
* Download the resourcepack from the `Resource-Pack` field
* Set `Send-Pack-On-Join: false` in the `config.yml` of **Space**
* Extract `assets` folder of the **Space** resourcepack inside `plugins\ItemsAdder\data\resource_pack\`
* Start the server
* Run `/iazip` (and follow the [hosting tutorial](../../plugin-usage/resourcepack-hosting/) if needed)

### Done!

## Known issues

### Particles problems

After you've merged the resourcepacks you will notice double particles from blocks. This is normal and I can't fix it for now.
