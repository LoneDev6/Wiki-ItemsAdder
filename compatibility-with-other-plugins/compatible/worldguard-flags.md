## Common issues

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your users **cannot sit** on **furnitures** even if you set the correct flag:

* check if you are using the `__global__ region` as your main region (the one on which you applied the furniture flag). If yes, please create a new region. global region is known to give some issues with some plugins flags.
* check if you set the `build` or `passthrough` flag. \
  Remember that these flags must not be changed, you should keep the default value (unselected, gray text)
