## Adding custom channel prefix in chat

If you want to create a graphical prefix for your channels and show it in chat you have to follow this tutorial.

![An example that shows the ARCADE prefix for the Arcade channel](<../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (94).png>)

You just have to set this in your format configuration, (for example in the `format/arcade.yml` file of ChatControl Red):

```yaml
  prefix:
    Message: ':arcade:'
```

Obviously you have to use your own [font\_image ](../../plugin-usage/advanced/font-images/)name instead of `arcade`, this is just an example.
