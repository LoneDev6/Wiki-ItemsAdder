# Plugin Doesn't Work

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Please read this page carefully before asking for support.

Most issues can be resolved by following the steps outlined here.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1: Revisit the Installation Tutorial

Ensure you have followed the installation tutorial on a clean server setup.

[First Installation Guide](../plugin-usage/first-install.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Step 2: Remove Recently Installed Plugins

If the issue started after adding a new plugin, try removing it, restoring from a server backup, or downgrading the updated plugin/server version to see if the problem persists.

## Step 3: Update Dependencies

Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date. Outdated JAR files can often cause compatibility issues.
