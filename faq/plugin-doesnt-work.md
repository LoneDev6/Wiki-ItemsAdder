# Plugin doesn't work

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Please read this page CAREFULLY before asking for support.

Most of the times the issue can be easily fixed by reading this page.
{% endhint %}

## Read the install tutorial again

Try again to follow the installation tutorial on a clean server.

{% content-ref url="../plugin-usage/first-install.md" %}
[first-install.md](../plugin-usage/first-install.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Remove any recently installed plugin

Try to remove the new plugin, restore from a server backup, or downgrade the updated plugin/server version and check if the issue persists.

## Update all dependencies

Update all dependencies, sometimes outdated JARs can cause issues.

## Follow the resourcepack troubleshooting tutorial

{% content-ref url="identify-why-textures-are-not-shown.md" %}
[identify-why-textures-are-not-shown.md](identify-why-textures-are-not-shown.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Ask on Discord

Someone might have the same issue. Try also to use the search button.

## **Report the bug if you still have issues** <a href="#if-you-still-have-problems-please-read-this-and-then-contact-me" id="if-you-still-have-problems-please-read-this-and-then-contact-me"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use the search button before submitting a report, people might already have reported it.
{% endhint %}

When you report something be sure to:

* follow every single step of my tutorials and make sure to read all the wiki.&#x20;
* test the plugin on a **CLEAN** server (with only **ItemsAdder** installed) since it could be a plugin interfering.
* use the latest version of the plugin, its dependencies and server.

If the problem persists, and you think it's a bug, send me these information when you report the problem:

* Exactly what you did to trigger the problem
* Server version, use `/version` command and send me the exact text it shows (use it in console to copy and paste)
* Plugin version
* Tell me if you edited the `.yml` files of ItemsAdder
* Tell me if you edited the resourcepack
* Zip ItemsAdder `.yml` files and send me them
* Specify if the plugin shows error in console or in chat
* Complete log of your server (not just a small portion of the error you see of **ItemsAdder** or I can't identify the issue)
