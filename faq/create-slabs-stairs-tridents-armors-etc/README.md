# Create slabs, stairs, tridents, armors...

### Placeable

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can't create solid custom slabs, stairs and solid placeable items other than blocks. Problem is that Minecraft would show them as transparent blocks because of this limitation: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-54254](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-54254) \
You'll be able to create custom shaped blocks when Mojang will add this feature: a special tag that can be turned on or off, now it's always on. **"Opaque"**.

Another reason is that I can't change hitbox of blocks.. sadly another Minecraft limitation.
{% endhint %}

### Tridents

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can't create custom model for thrown tridents as it's a Minecraft bug I can't fix: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-155286](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-155286)
{% endhint %}

### Armors

{% hint style="warning" %}
Minecraft 1.16 (and lower) doesn't allow you to add custom textures / custom 3D models to armors in any way (you can but only with Optifine).\
You can make them colored but you cannot change the texture.

### Custom textured armors 1.17

To create custom textured armors in 1.17 you can follow the [tutorial here](../../plugin-usage/adding-content/armors/texture.md) (No Optifine).

### Custom textured armors 1.16 (and lower)

ItemsAdder can automatically add custom armors to 1.16 version and lower, but only if the user has Optifine installed. Read [more here](../../plugin-usage/adding-content/armors/texture.md).

### Elytra

{% hint style="warning" %}
Minecraft doesn't allow you in any way to add custom textures / custom 3D models to elytras.
