# ðŸ¦´ Emotes with more joins

## Why can't emotes have more joints?

### Reason 1

Emotes with multiple joints animations look <mark style="color:red;">**awful**</mark>, they ruin the Minecraft feel and remind of the cringe YouTube Minecraft animations like this:

### Reason 2

The current emotes have the same style of Bedrock edition emotes, which follows the Mojang style guidelines.

### Reason 3

Adding more joins would require a **complete rewrite** of the animations code which would take weeks of coding.
