# Broken emote textures

## Shader Mod issues

Mods that allow the usage of custom shaders will break emotes due to them overriding/replacing the vanilla Shader which ItemsAdder uses for the Emotes feature.

The only way to _"fix"_ this is by disabling the shaders themself or removing the shader mod in question.

## Mods that change the player skins

A mod may change the default player model/skin and can therefore be affected by ItemsAdder's shader manipulations, or vice-versa.

Known Mods that cause issues:

### 3DSkinLayers

The mod alters the outer skin layer to make them appear in 3D, which alters the player model itself.

A possible fix is to disable `3D Skulls` and `3D Skull Items` in the mod's settings.\
There is currently no workaround for using 3D layers in Emote animations.

Additional information can be found in the related issue: [https://github.com/tr7zw/3d-Skin-Layers/issues/45](https://github.com/tr7zw/3d-Skin-Layers/issues/45)

### Customizable Player Models

This mod allows the complete customization of the player model including replacing parts of it or the model as a whole.\
Due to this will Emotes not display properly in ItemsAdder and there is currently no fix available outside of not using the mod or not using the Emote animations.
