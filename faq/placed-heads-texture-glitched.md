# Placed heads texture glitched

{% hint style="success" %}
This bug is less frequent on ItemsAdder 4.0.10 and greater. Consider updating!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This is caused by the emotes feature of ItemsAdder and currently there is no fix other than disabling them.
{% endhint %}

This bug happens if you have more than 1 player head of the same player in front of you.\
This doesn't happen if you have different player heads in front of you or if you have only 1 head in front of you.

## How to fix

The only way to fix this is to disable emotes system in `config.yml` of **ItemsAdder**.\
Don't forget to regenerate the resourcepack using `/iazip`.
