# Slabs, stairs, doors etc.

### Slabs and stairs

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can't create solid custom slabs and stairs.\
The problem is that Minecraft doesn't allow custom hitboxes for custom blocks.

In the future I might implement something to do that with some workarounds, but for now it's not possible.
{% endhint %}
