# Slabs, stairs, tridents, elytra etc.

### Slabs and stairs

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can't create solid custom slabs and stairs.\
The problem is that Minecraft doesn't allow custom hitboxes for custom blocks.
{% endhint %}

### Tridents

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can't create custom model for thrown tridents as it's a Minecraft bug which I can't fix: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-155286](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-155286)
{% endhint %}

### Elytra

{% hint style="success" %}
Will be added in future ItemsAdder versions, but will require 1.21.2 clients.
{% endhint %}
