# 🥾 Kick flight on join

## The kick problem

Some servers may think you're flying while the resourcepack is installing, depends on where is your spawn location.

You may get this error: <mark style="color:red;">"Flying is not enabled on this server"</mark>, or getting kicked by an **anticheat**.

## How to fix?

Disable the `hide-hud` feature in the `config.yml` file of **ItemsAdder**.

```yaml
  protect-player:
    black-screen: true
    hide-hud: false
```

## Still having the issue

Enable this option in `server.properties` file:

{% code title="server.properties" %}
```
allow-flight=true
```
{% endcode %}
