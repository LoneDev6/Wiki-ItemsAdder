# ☐ characters

## I see ☐ character after uninstalling Custom ESC addon

{% hint style="info" %}
This is useful to uninstall [Custom ESC addon](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/addon-custom-esc-menu-and-death-screen-for-itemsadder.88809/)
{% endhint %}

You have to delete this folder lang folder: `data\resource_pack\assets\minecraft\lang`

Then run `/iazip` command.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/immagine (151).png>)

## I see ☐ instead of my emojis/ranks

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to run `/iazip` and reupload the resourcepack if needed.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure `y_position` property is not greater than the image height in pixels.

Minecraft doesn't support this, it won't work.
{% endhint %}
