# Recipes book problems

{% hint style="info" %}
These limitations are valid for EVERY Spigot plugin that creates custom recipes with custom items as ingredients, it's not an ItemsAdder bug and I can't fix it in any way.

Please don't report these bugs, I can't really do anything to fix this problem, it's a Minecraft limitation.
{% endhint %}

## "Showing Craftable" button not working correctly

"Showing Craftable" button doesn't work with recipes that use custom items as ingredients.

### How to fix?

Set the button like that when you want to find an ItemsAdder recipe in the book.

## Red recipes even if ingredients are in inventory

There is no fix for this, it's a Minecraft bug.
