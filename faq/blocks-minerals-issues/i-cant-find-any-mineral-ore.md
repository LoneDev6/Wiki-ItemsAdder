# I can't find any mineral/ore

## Common causes of this can be:

* you are searching ores in a **pregenerated world**. \
  Ores will spawn only on new generated chunks (generated after ItemsAdder installation).\
  This is exactly how vanilla Minecraft works. You don't get new ores in old chunks when you update the game.
* you are searching ores around **spawn location**. Please try to **teleport far** from **spawn**
* you are searching ores in a world with a custom name.\
  You have to add the world name in the file: `plugins\ItemsAdder\data\items_packs\itemsadder\blocks.yml` for **each ore** configuration**.**
