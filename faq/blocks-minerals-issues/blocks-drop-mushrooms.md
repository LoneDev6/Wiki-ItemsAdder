# Blocks drop Mushrooms, Chorus, Noteblocks

### First reason

If you have [EmeraldEnchants2 ](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/EmeraldEnchants2)installed [read this](https://github.com/LoneDev6/ItemsAdder/issues/123)

### Second reason

Did you delete the custom blocks folders in your world? Don't do it.

If you delete it you lose every custom ItemsAdder block data in the world.

### Third reason

Corrupted chunk. This can happen if you:

* killed the server while it was saving an IA region file
* full disk problem which blocked saving of files
* reloaded the plugin using **Plugman** or similar
* reloaded the server using `/reload` command
