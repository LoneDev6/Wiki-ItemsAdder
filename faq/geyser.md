# Geyser

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Geyser is not officially supported.

Geyser is a complex plugin and it's not easy to integrate resourcepacks plugins to have the same experience on Bedrock and Java.

In the future I might write down some official tutorials or official compatibility layers, but for  now I don't advice to use Geyser for your server.
