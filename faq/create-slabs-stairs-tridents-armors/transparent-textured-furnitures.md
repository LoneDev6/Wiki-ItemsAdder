# Transparent textured furnitures

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to make some transparent or semi-transparent textures you have to make sure you based your item on a vanilla item that accepts transparency.
{% endhint %}

### Example:

```yaml
resource:
  material: WHITE_STAINED_GLASS
  generate: false
  model_path: item/your_model
```

![Example: potion bottles with semi-transparency](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)
