# Create transparent textured furnitures

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to make some transparent/semi transparent textures you have to make sure you based your item on a vanilla item that accepts transparency.  
For example:
{% endhint %}

```yaml
resource:
  material: WHITE_STAINED_GLASS
  generate: false
  model_path: item/your_model
```
