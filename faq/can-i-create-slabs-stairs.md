# Can I create slabs, stairs, tridents, armors...

### Placeable

{% hint style="warning" %}
 You can't create solid custom slabs, stairs and solid placeable items other than blocks. Problem is that Minecraft would show them as transparent blocks because of this bug: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-54254](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-54254) You'll be able to create custom shaped blocks when Mojang will fix this bug \(adding a special tag that can be turned on or off, now it's always on. **"Opaque"**\).

Another reason is that I can't change hitbox of blocks.. sadly another Minecraft limitation.
{% endhint %}

### Tridents

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can't create custom model for thrown tridents as it's a Minecraft bug I can't fix: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-155286](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-155286)
{% endhint %}

### Armors

{% hint style="warning" %}
Minecraft doesn't allow you in any way to add custom textures / custom 3D models to armors.  
You can make them colored but you cannot change the texture.
