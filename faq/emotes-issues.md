# Emotes Issues

Make sure you accepted the resourcepack and that you enabled emotes in `config.yml` of ItemsAdder. Try also to regenerate the pack using `/iazip`.

## Case 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

```yaml
emotes:
  1_21_5_to_1_21_9_shaders: true
```

If you join with a _1.21.9_ or newer client and enable `1_21_5_to_1_21_9_shaders`, emotes will render incorrectly and the player head can appear stretched. This happens because `1_21_5_to_1_21_9_shaders` supports only versions _1.21.5_ through _1.21.9_.

If you want to support 1.21.4 and greater clients, you must use `1_21_4_plus_modern_method` instead (and regenerate your resourcepack).

## Case 2

<div><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

If you're on a _1.21.3_ or older client, you can't use `1_21_4_plus_modern_method`. You must keep using `1_21_5_plus_emotes_shaders`.

## Case 3

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you are using `1_21_5_plus_emotes_shaders` or `legacy_shaders`, you might have a plugin or another pack that is overwriting the shaders (only _1.21.8_ and lower clients can have this issue).

Check the files in the merged resourcepack folders:

{% code title="config.yml" %}
```yaml
merge_other_plugins_resourcepacks_folders:
- ModelEngine/resource pack
```
{% endcode %}

Also check your `ItemsAdder/contents` folders for any shader that can interfere.

## Mods issues (only related to vanilla shader method)

If you are using `1_21_5_plus_emotes_shaders` or `legacy_shaders`, you will have this issue using shader mods (only _1.21.8_ and lower clients can have this issue).

Mods that allow the usage of custom shaders will break emotes due to them overriding/replacing the vanilla Shader which ItemsAdder uses for the Emotes feature.

The only way to _"fix"_ this is by disabling the shaders themself or removing the shader mod in question.

### Known shader mods that cause issues

* Optifine: [https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/6391](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/issues/6391)
* IrisShaders: [https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/issues/1042](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/issues/1042)
* Mods that change the player skins:&#x20;
  * A mod may change the default player model/skin and can therefore be affected by ItemsAdder's shader manipulations, or vice-versa.
* 3DSkinLayers
  * The mod alters the outer skin layer to make them appear in 3D, which alters the player model itself.\
    A possible fix is to disable 3D Skulls and 3D Skull Items in the mod's settings.\
    There is currently no workaround for using 3D layers in Emote animations.\
    Additional information can be found in the [related issue](https://github.com/tr7zw/3d-Skin-Layers/issues/45).
* Customizable Player Models
  * These mods allows the complete customization of the player model including replacing parts of it or the model as a whole.\
    Due to this will Emotes not display properly in ItemsAdder and there is currently no fix available outside of not using the mod or not using the Emote animations.
