# Citizens NPC doesn't rotate head

This is a known issue and seems to happen only on 1.19+ with the latest version of Citizens.\
Currently I didn't find any way to fix that, I'll try to find a solution in the next updates.

## Paper 1.19.2 + Citizens 2.0.30

Working correctly.

## Paper 1.19.4 + Citizens 2.0.31
