## [PLEASE UPDATE TO THE LATEST VERSION](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9C%A8itemsadder%E2%AD%90emotes-mobs-items-armors-hud-gui-emojis-blocks-wings-hats-liquids.73355/)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
This problem was fixed long time ago, if you still have this problem probably it's a bug introduced again by Mojang
{% endhint %}

If some of your users crash it's because of a Minecraft bug which is really deep inside game logic.\
Problem is that some Intel HD Graphics cards have a driver bug that cause game to crash if custom fonts are included in the resourcepack.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only way to fix this is to disable [custom font](../../plugin-usage/adding-content/fonts/method-1.md) functionality of the plugin..\
Yes I know it's a shame but I can't do much, it's Mojang fault.\
\
You can read about that here: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-176595](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-176595)
