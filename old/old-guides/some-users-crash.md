# ☠️Some users crash

{% hint style="success" %}
This problem was fixed long time ago, if you still have this problem probably it's a bug introduced again by Mojang
{% endhint %}

If some of your users crash it's because of a Minecraft bug which is really deep inside game logic.\
Problem is that some Intel HD Graphics cards have a driver bug that cause game to crash if custom fonts are included in the resourcepack.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only way to fix this is to disable [custom font](../../plugin-usage/advanced/fonts/method-1.md) functionality of the plugin..\
Yes I know it's a shame but I can't do much, it's Mojang fault.\

You can read about that here: [https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-176595](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-176595)
