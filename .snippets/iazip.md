!!! refresh "Remember to update the resource pack!"
    Always remember to run `/iazip` after altering anything in the `data` folder or in the `config.yml` to refresh the resource pack.
    
    **Using External host?**  
    Upload the updated `pack.zip` (Located under `/plugins/ItemsAdder/data/resource_pack/`) to the external host you use and copy the new download URL for it.  
    Afterwards, replace `url` under `external-host` with the new URL, save the changes and run `/iareload` followed by `/iatexture all`.

    **Using self-host/auto-external-host?**  
    The resource pack should be updated automatically and applied to all online players.  
    If not, run `/iatexture all` to force a refresh of the resource pack for all players.
