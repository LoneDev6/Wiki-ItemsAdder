# Adding custom Furniture

## What is furniture?
A furniture is a custom, decorative object which can be solid, emit light, can be sit on or have other functionality.  
The below listed pages will guide you through how you can create such stuff.

!!! warning "Limitations"
    #### Item Frame Furnitures
    
    - Solid Item Frame furnitures are only possible on Server versions 1.16 and newer. Client version doesn't matter for this.
    - Furniture with invisible item frames are only working properly on Client versions 1.16 and newer. Players joining with older versions (i.e. through usage of ViaVersion) will see the item frame.
    
    #### General limitations
    
    - Non-solid furnitures won't get any interaction events. They can only get removed using left-click and cannot be interacted with. Only solid furniture supports interactions.
    - Due to perfomance reasons is the total size of a hitbox limited to 3x3x3 blocks.
