# Emote Bugs

## Skin textures are broken when using Shaders

This is a compatability issue with OptiFine/Iris that cannot be fixed without changes to those mods.

## Skin textures are broken without Shaders

Are you using [3D Skin Layers][3dskinlayers]?  
This is a bug caused by the mod altering the head model to apply the 3D Layer effect. This cannot be fixed on ItemsAdder's end.
