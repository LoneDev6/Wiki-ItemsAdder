# Textures won't load

When the textures won't load for you (Items show as vanilla ones), try the following steps:

- Enable Output logs for your Launcher profile  
  ![output logs](/assets/images/faq/output-logs.png){ loading=lazy }
- Start the Client, join the server and check the logs for any warnings or errors  
  ![client logs](/assets/images/faq/client-logs.png){ loading=lazy }
- Locate the broken/missing files and fix them. The errors should tell you what is wrong
